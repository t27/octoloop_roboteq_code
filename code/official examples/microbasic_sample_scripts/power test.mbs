' Read the battery voltage. It is the 1st of the 3 Voltages that can be retrieved from teh controller
BatteryVolts = getvalue(_VOLTS, 1)
' Compute power from each channel by multiplying the retrieve battery amps by the battery voltage
' Since Amps and Volts are measured x10 each (ie, 245 = 24.5), the result must be divided by 10
' For best precision do all the multiplications first. Because the math is done with integers only
' (i.e. no decimals), getvalue(_BATAMPS, 1) /100 * BatteryVolts would not give an accurate result 
' even though the formula is mathematically equivalent.
Power1 = (getvalue(_BATAMPS, 1) * BatteryVolts) / 100
Power2 = (getvalue(_BATAMPS, 2) * BatteryVolts) / 100

' Output the two power values. E.g. W=55:66. Terminate with "\r" for cariage return
